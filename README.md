# Spotify Songs Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes Spotify song data and presents insights through an interactive Plotly Dash dashboard. The analysis is first conducted in a Jupyter notebook to explore the data and determine the most insightful visualizations.

## Project Structure
- `spotify_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data analysis and visualization exploration
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required for the project
- (Dashboard files will be added later)

## Setup Instructions

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open `spotify_analysis.ipynb` to start the analysis

## Next Steps
1. Explore and clean the Spotify dataset
2. Create various visualizations to understand the data
3. Select the most insightful visualizations for the dashboard
4. Implement the Plotly Dash dashboard
